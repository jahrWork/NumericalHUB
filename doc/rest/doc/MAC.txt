Author: Juan A. Hernandez:  juanantonio.hernandez@upm.es 


1) How to execute a Terminal 

    Applications/ Utilities/ Terminal
    
2) How to execute a Terminal in a specific folder

    Sistem Preferences/ Keyboard/ Speed functions/ Services - scroll and select "Terminal in the folder"
    
    
    
3) Install gFortran to compile

       3.1) Install manager HOMEBREW (https://brew.sh)
       3.2) $ brew install gcc
       
     
4) Install Openmotiff

      4.1) Install server X11 through XQuartz (https://www.xquartz.org)
           Capability to start 64-bit GUI-programs using x-windows from the shell 
        
      4.1)$ brew install openmotif
     
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
    
    
3) Install gFortran to compile

    Download the corresponding version in https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries (e.g. for macOS Sierra download gfortran 6.3)
    
4) Install DISLIN to plot 

    a) Install dislin (from dislin distribution page 64 bits MAC http://www.mps.mpg.de/dislin/mac-osx-darwin ) following all the steps
   
        Create a dislin folder in directory HOME (main folder of the user, where documents, photos, music,.. are) and copy all the folders inside.
   
    b) Install OpenMotif library 
   
        b.1) Install server program X11 through XQuartz (https://www.xquartz.org)
        
        b.2) Install manager HOMEBREW (https://brew.sh)

        b.3) Execute in a Terminal: brew install openmotif

        b.4) Search the path where HOMEBREW has been installed by writing in the Terminal:  which brew 
         
        b.5) copy the path up to HOMEBREW and write in the terminal:  open <path obtained after which brew>/homebrew/Cellar/openmotif
    
        b.6) Finder window will pop up. Open the folder OpenMotif followed by its version (e.g. 2.3.7)

        b.7) Open the lib folder and copy libXm.4.dylib in the dislin folder

        b.8) Rename all the libraries (dylib) in the dislin folder removing the version numbers:  libdislin.dylib libdislin_d.dylib libXm.dylib 

        b.9) Open a Terminal in the dislin folder: cd dislin (or clicking the right buton of the mouse over the folder)

        b.10) Modify permissions of OpenMotif library:  chmod +x libXm.dylib chmod +uw libXm.dylib 

        b.11) Execute the following commands: install_name_tool -id "@loader_path/libXm.dylib" libXm.dylib  install_name_tool -id "@loader_path/libdislin.dylib" libdislin.dylib  install_name_tool -id "@loader_path/libdislin_d.dylib" libdislin_d.dylib 

        b.12) Modify PATH so that Terminal can find user HOME and execute:  open -e .bash_profile or touch ~/.bash_profile; open ~/.bash_profile

        b.13) Program TextEdit window will open to edit session configuration for the Terminal. Add the following line at the end of the file:  export PATH=/usr/local/bin:${PATH}

        b.14) Save and close TextEdit and Terminal 

        b.15) Open a new Terminal and write: gfortran --version

6) Compile Fortran using Hello World program with dislin libraries
    
    a) Create a folder in the working space and copy the following libraries: dislin.f90 libdislin.dylib libXm.dylib, as well as our sources: Hello_world.f90 and plot_graph.f90 

    b) Compile DISLIN source:  gfortran -c dislin.f90
    
    c) Compile the program source: gfortran -c Hello_world.f90

    d) Link files with libraries to obtain executable file: gfortran -o Hello world Hello_world.o -L. -ldislin -L. -lXm
    
    e) To test the compiled program, write in the Terminal: ./Hello_world   

    f) Compile the program source: gfortran -c plot_graph.f90

    g) Link files with libraries to obtain executable file: gfortran -o plot_graph plot_graph.o -L. -ldislin -L. -lXm
    
    h) To test the compiled program, write in the Terminal: ./plot_graph
    
    i) An X Window should open with a graph. If it display cannot be opened go to Application/ Utilities and open XQuartz for the first time
