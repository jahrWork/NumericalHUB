<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>

1.  <em>When I click on a recipe or example file (ending in .for or .f),
it doesn't display correctly in my browser and/or it opens
an inappropriate external application.</em><p>

<font size="-1">
You need to teach your browser how to handle Fortran files with
.for and/or .f90 extensions.
<ol>
<li>In Netscape (version 4.XX -- similar in other
versions), you go to Edit/Preferences...
and choose Navigator/Applications.  Now go to step 3.

<li>For Microsoft Internet Explorer, you go to View/Folder Options...
from the menu bar of any open folder (not from Microsoft Internet
Explorer!).  Choose File Types.  Now go to step 3.

<li>Highlight, and then page
through with down arrow, all the file types, looking for any
that list extension "FOR" or "F90" under "File type details".
If you find one, then Edit it.  If you don't find one, then
create a New Type.  In either case set the MIME type to
text/plain, and be sure that the extensions are .for and .f90 .

<li>For Netscape, now choose whether to display the file within
Netscape, or to use an external application.  In the latter
case, you might choose a simple text editor (notepad, emacs, etc.),
or you might choose a Fortran development environment (Microsoft Visual
Studio, etc.).  If you want the option of saving the file to disk
as the default, then check the "Ask me" box.

<li>For Microsoft Internet Explorer, now edit or create an
action named "open", and choose an external application to
use. You might choose a simple text editor (notepad, emacs, etc.),
or you might choose a Fortran development environment (Microsoft Visual
Studio, etc.).
</ol>

If these instructions are not sufficient, you'll need to consult
the help files for your browser.  All our source code files
are plain text files with conventional extensions.<p>

</font>

2. <em>OK, I can see the files, but how do I save selected
files to (e.g.) a working directory for a programming project?</em><p>

<font size="-1">
<ol>
<li> If you are already displaying the contents of the file,
go back to where you see a browser page with a link to the file.
<li> For Netscape, hold down the Shift key and then left-click on
the link.  You will get a Save As dialog box from which you
can select a destination folder.
<li> For Microsoft Internet Explorer, right-click on the link,
and then choose Save Target As in the context menu.  You will get
a dialog box from which you can select a destination folder.
</ol>

If this doesn't work, you can always just get out of your
browser and copy the files from their folders to your
destination folder.  They are not in any way encoded.<p>
</font>

3. <em>Your links are all messed up!  The links are in lower-case,
but the file names are in upper case.  (Or: some of your links
are longer than 8 letters, but the file names are truncated to
8 letters.)</em><p>

<font size="-1">
This should never happen in Windows.  If it happens in UNIX
or Linux, it means that you are using a Windows (not UNIX/Linux)
version of the CDROM, and that you have mounted it incorrectly,
without mapping the file system to long file names and upper/lower
case.  Since the Windows disk is not licensed for use on UNIX/Linux
systems at all, we can offer you no assistance.<p>
